DAX stands for Data Analysis Expressions  
It is basically a formulae language with functions  
  
In this project I got hands on over DAX queries by playing around with datasets in Power BI Desktop. 
  
First, I modelled the data by understanding the relationsips between tables "Orders", "Customers" and "Cookie Types"  
  
Power BI had already detected One-to-Many relation between Customer ID of "Customers" table and Customer ID of "Orders" table,which means one customer can place  
many orders.  

Then I manually drew a One-to-Many relation between Cookie Type of "Cookie Types" and Product of "Orders" table, which means one individual cookie type can be  
in many product orders.  
  
Queries  
Aggregator Function (by Column)   

1. Total Number of Units Sold = SUM(Orders[Units Sold])
   Change the data type of the new field "Total Number of Units Sold" to 0 decimal values as cookies can not be sold in the franctions.  
  
2. Count of Orders = COUNTROWS(Orders)  
  
3. Distinct Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Customer ID])    
  
4. Profit Margin % = [Total Profit] / SUM(Orders[Revenue])  

Iterator Function (by Row)  

1. Total Profit by Row = SUMX('Cookie Types', 'Cookie Types'[Units Sold] * 'Cookie Types'[Revenue Per Cookie] - 'Cookie Types'[Cost Per Cookie])  
  
Time and Date Functions  

1. Day of Week = WEEKDAY(Orders[Date],1)  
  
Logical Functions  
  
1. Has Chocolate = FIND("Chocolate", Orders[Product],1,0)  
  
2. Chocolate In = IF(FIND("Chocolate",Orders[Product],1,0) >0 ,"Chocolate Inside" , "No Chocolate")  
  
Calculate Function  
  
1. Chocolate Chip sold over 500 Units = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Orders),Orders[Units Sold] > 500,Orders[Product] == "Chocolate Chip")
